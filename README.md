Requirements
To run this game, you'll need:

Python 3.x (ensure Python is installed on your system).
Pygame library (for rendering the game window and handling game mechanics).
To install Pygame, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Game Instructions
Use the arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) to control the movement of the snake.
Eat the food (represented by yellow blocks) to grow longer.
Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen and with the snake's body.
If you collide, the game will display your final score and give you the option to quit or play again.
How to Play
Run the snake_game.py file:

bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
The game window will open, and you can start playing.

The score is displayed at the top left of the screen.

The snake's speed will increase as it eats food.

The game will end when the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.

After losing, press Q to quit or C to play again.

Game Loop
